# Weather-App-Javascript

This weather app which is built using Javascript will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, 
an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the 
user's city and country (New Delhi, DL).When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
